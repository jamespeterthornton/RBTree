Welcome -

This is a Java applet for displaying an RBTree. You can add, delete, and insert.

In order to run this, start by downloading the files. Make sure to keep them in the same folder.

Then set up a local server. One way to do this is to open up terminal, cd to the directory 
with these files in it, and type 

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &.

Then, open the html file in a web browser that supports Java Applets (i.e., anything but 
Chrome) and enjoy.
